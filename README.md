# ContinuousIrradiation

This code has been created to model the data obtained during irradiation by constant light source in stationary spectrometer. It allows to define the points where light has been switched off or modified, so model describing the system is still the same, but conditions changed.
Program has graphical plugin to build the model of transitions between states and allows to fix and unfix almost any parameter during fitting process of the data, so everything can be perfectly tuned to get the best data description possible.
